# MonkeyTalk

MonkeyTalk is a web application inspired by reddit in which a user can post a
topic (usually a link) in which others will be able to comment and vote on.
Users are able to create an account by signing up, which will require a standard
email and password in addition to the username to be displayed. This information
can always be adjusted by going to the accounts page. Once authenticated, a user
can make comments and vote on links posted by others as well as edit or share
their own links. Users are still able to view links without authentication, however, other
options are restricted.
